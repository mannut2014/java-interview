---

IO is very important from Java interview point of view. You should have a good knowledge of old Java IO, NIO, and NIO2 along with some operating system and disk IO fundamentals. Here are some frequently asked questions form Java IO.

List questions:

1. [In my Java program, I have three sockets? How many threads I will need to handle that?]()
1. [How do you create ByteBuffer in Java?]()
1. [How do you write and read from ByteBuffer in Java?]()
1. [Is Java BIG endian or LITTLE endian?]()
1. [What is the byte order of ByteBuffer?]()
1. [The difference between direct buffer and non-direct buffer in Java?]()
1. [What is the memory mapped buffer in Java?]()
1. [What is TCP NO DELAY socket option?]()
1. [What is the difference between TCP and UDP protocol?]()
1. [The difference between ByteBuffer and StringBuffer in Java?]()
1. [What is a stream and what are the types of Streams and classes of the Streams?]()
1. [What is the difference between Reader/Writer and InputStream/Output Stream?]()
1. [What is an I/O filter?]()
